Provides convenient methods for developers to debug buggy code.

== Description ==

This plugin is for developers.  Wherever you need to find out what is happening in your code place wh_debug('name', $value) in there.  Where 'name' describes what you are trying to debug and $value is the value you want to see.  Run your code and see the value(s) in a table on the admin side under Tools->WH Debug.

Development for this plugin is based on my needs and free time.
